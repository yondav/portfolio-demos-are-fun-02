# Updated Portfolio

For this assignment, I decided to challenge myself and try a few things I had never done before. I tried to create a more fun and dynamic UI with JavaScript and CSS. I also worked with node for the first time to set up a server and accept email submissions from the contact form.

### Takeaway

It's been a lot of fun challenging myself to create a dynamic and fun experience on my portfolio page. This being the second phase my portfolio since starting the course made very clear how far my skills and intuition have come. It's certainly not perfect and it is all pretty vanilla but I did learn a lot and I'm excited to have accomplished things I had never tried before. This will be a fun thing to continue revisiting and refactoring over time but it was very exciting to work on this.
