The assignment at hand was to build a simple portfolio from scratch using html and css. I had spent a lot of time this week playing with some ideas I had for a more complex website and diving into using javascript. Ultimately I scrapped that site for the sake of submitting something I was more confident in my ability to complete but I did learn a lot this week while working on this project. This was a great exercise in thinking about html structure and understanding the ways that different css methods work and how they respond to one another. 

Additionally, my exploration of simple javascript has left me in a pretty exciting place. I was able to accomplish a few things that I spent countless hours trying to wrap my head around. Overall I enjoyed this project for those reasons. I learned quite a bit and I think I came out of it with a skeleton to build on in the future.
