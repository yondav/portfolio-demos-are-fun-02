The assignment was to build a simple portfolio using html and css. I had spent a lot of time this week playing with some ideas for a more complex website using a bit of javascript. I ultimately scrapped that site for the sake of submitting something I was more confident in my ability to complete but I did learn a lot while working on this project. This was a great exercise in thinking about html structure and understanding the ways that different css methods work and how they respond to one another.
